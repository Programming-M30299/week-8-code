# Code from Week 8

A repository containing the examples from the worksheet and the lectures.

## Contents

- `pract8.py` - A file containing the examples from the worksheet.
  Copy the contents of this file into yours and run the functions to see what they do.
- `house.py` - This file defines a program that draws a house with a customizable door colour and window light status. The user is prompted to input the door colour and whether the lights are on or off. Call the `main` function to try this program.
- `tennis.py` - This file defines a program that simulates a tennis match between two players. The user is prompted to input the probability of winning a point and the number of games to simulate. The program then simulates the games and outputs the number of wins and the proportion of wins for the player. Call the `main` function to try this program.
- `README.md` - This file.
- `.gitignore` - A file telling git to ignore certain files (e.g. `.pyc` files).
  You do not need to worry about this file for now.
